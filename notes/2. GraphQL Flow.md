- GraphQl server does not understand anything. we have to tell him what is this information and what will it return. It helps us to do these things what we tell it.
- You will tell what you want to expose and then what will someone get in response when they hit your exposed endpoint.
```
const schema=gql`
 
 type Query:{
     employees: [Employee] // I exposed employees here
 }
 
 // Now they will get this information==([Employee]) when they hit my exposed endpoint of employees.

 type Employee {
     id: string!;
     firstName: string;
      lastName: string;
      description: string;
 }`

```
- Now we have these information, we have to provide this to Graph QL Server. So we can do it when we create server, just by passing this configuration to the server.

```
const gqlServer=new ApolloServer({schema});
```
- Now we can start server and it will redirect us to Graph Ql playground.
- Graph request are always **POST** type.
- Now, we have our schema ( Database table), we have to fill data for keys/columns and tell graph QL what key should be returned.
  1. For this, we have to write Resolvers to work and tell Graph QL that what data should it return and what key.
  2. ```
      const resolvers = {
      Query: {
        employees: () => {
            <!-- return {
                firstName : "Taslim" // This line will give use error because we are expecting employees as an Array of Object but return as an Object only.
            } -->

            <!-- return [{
                message: "Hey there" // Gives error as message key is not present in our schema
            }] -->
            <!-- Below is correct way -->
            return [{firstName: "Taslim"}]
        }
       }
      }
      ```
  3. Now just pass this resolver along with Schema to the server.
  
  ```
  const gqlServer=new ApolloServer({schema,resolvers});
  ```
