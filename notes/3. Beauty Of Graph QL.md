1. Beauty of Graph QL is that we just write DTO (Data transfer Object) and whenever any change in requirement comes, we don't need to change anything, we just need to provide key name in Graph QL entry according to need.
2. But in Rest either we have to change DTO or return everything and decide what you need, which is extra overhead and security concern because we are showing unnecessary data to client.
3. We  don't change anything in Microservice which is the beauty of Graph QL, just go to your frontend and provide name of key which you want.

> DTO==>
```{
    id: string!;
    firstName : string!;
    lastName: string!;
    age : number;
    phone : string;
    alternatePhone: string;
    email: string;
    alternateEmail: string;
    description: string;
    profession : string;
    message: string;
    department: string;
    company: string;
}
```
- Initially in the frontend we just need id, firstName, lastName, age, department and description.

Our query would be: 
```
{
    id: string;
    firstName : string;
    lastName : string;
    age : number;
    description: string;
    department: string;
}
```
- Now we need to show company name as well, just go to frontend and query company name, that's it.

Now Our query would be: 
```
{
    id: string;
    firstName : string;
    lastName : string;
    age : number;
    description: string;
    department: string;
    company: string;
}
```
