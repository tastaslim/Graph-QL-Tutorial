1. we should not return data directly from reading database in the graph QL part. No this is a bad practice.
2. Instead we should make some data source classes and make some appropriate functions and read data from database/file/anywhere and return required data.
3. For that we need to install **apollo-datasource** library. 
```
const {DataSource} = require('apollo-datasource');
const {employees} = require("./database/data.json"); // some json as database

class EmployeeService extends DataSource{
    constructor(){
        super();
    }

    public listEmployees(){
        return employees;
    }
}

module.exports= EmployeeService;
```
4. Now import this datasource and use this service methods.
5. Benefit of doing this way is that now resolver don't need to worry about from where (can be file, database or anything) data is coming because our datasource service will be handling it internally.
