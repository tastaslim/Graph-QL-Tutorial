## Filter ## 
- Now I want to get data of a particular employee, I can do it using filters in Graph QL.
- If I have to filter list of employees on the some criteria say department, I can do that as well.
- For that we can use lodash npm package and use its filter function.
```
 const _=require("lodash");
 class xyz{
     methodXyz(args){
        return _.filter(employees, args); // FILTER ON THE BASIS OF ARGUMENTS( keys of table)
     }
 }
```
